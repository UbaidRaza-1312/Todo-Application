# Implementation Plan: Console to Web Platform Transformation

## User Input

```
**Project:** AI-Native Spec-Driven Full-Stack Todo Web App
**Tooling:** Spec-Kit Plus + **Qwen CLI**
**Approach:** Research-Concurrent | APA Style | Phase-Based

---

## 1. Purpose of This Plan

This **/sp.plan** defines how the project will be executed under a **spec-driven, AI-native workflow** using **Qwen CLI** as the only implementation agent.

Goals:

* Convert a console todo app into a **modern multi-user web application**
* Enforce **no manual coding**
* Evaluate the **process, prompts, and iterations**
* Ensure **secure, authenticated, persistent** task management

---

## 2. Development Philosophy

### 2.1 Agentic Dev Stack (Updated)

**Workflow:**

> Write Spec → Generate Plan → Break into Tasks →
> Implement via **Qwen CLI** → Review Output → Refine Spec → Repeat

**Rules**

* ❌ No manual coding
* ✅ All changes go through specs
* ✅ All code generated by **Qwen CLI**
* ✅ Every iteration is logged

---

## 3. Phase-Based Execution Model

The project follows three macro phases as required:

---

# Phase I — Research

**Goal:** Build strong technical and academic foundation.

## 4. Architecture Sketch (Textual)

```
[ Browser ]
     |
     v
[ Next.js Frontend ]
     |
     |  JWT (Authorization: Bearer <token>)
     v
[ FastAPI Backend ]
     |
     v
[ Neon PostgreSQL ]
```

### Auth Flow

1. User signs in via **Better Auth** (Next.js)
2. Better Auth issues **JWT**
3. Frontend attaches JWT to every API request
4. FastAPI verifies JWT using shared secret
5. Backend filters all data by authenticated user

---

## 5. Section Structure (Paper / Documentation)

1. **Introduction**
2. **Background & Related Work**
3. **Methodology**

   * Spec-driven workflow
   * AI-native development
4. **System Architecture**
5. **Implementation Using Qwen CLI**
6. **Security Design**
7. **Evaluation & Validation**
8. **Results**
9. **Discussion**
10. **Conclusion**
11. **References** (APA style)

---

## 6. Research Approach

### Model: Research-Concurrent

Instead of:

> Research → then Build

We use:

> Research + Build in parallel

### Why?

* Specs evolve with learning
* Security decisions improve mid-process
* Better reflects **real AI-assisted development**

---

## 7. Decisions Needing Documentation

These must be written in `/docs/decisions.md`.

---

### 7.1 Authentication Strategy

**Options**

* Session cookies
* JWT tokens

**Decision**

* ✅ JWT tokens

**Tradeoff**

* * Stateless, scalable
* − Token revocation harder

---

### 7.2 Monorepo vs Multi-Repo

**Options**

* Separate frontend/backend
* Monorepo

**Decision**

* ✅ Monorepo

**Tradeoff**

* * Single AI context for Qwen CLI
* − Larger repository

---

### 7.3 ORM Choice

**Options**

* SQLAlchemy
* SQLModel

**Decision**

* ✅ SQLModel

**Tradeoff**

* * Simpler, Pydantic integration
* − Less advanced features

---

### 7.4 AI Tooling

**Options**

**Decision**

* ✅ **Qwen CLI only**

**Tradeoff**

* * Open, flexible
* − Requires stronger specs

---

## 8. Testing Strategy

Testing is **spec-based validation**, not traditional manual QA.

---

## 8.1 Validation Levels

### 1. Spec Validation

* Are requirements unambiguous?
* Are acceptance criteria measurable?

### 2. AI Output Validation

* Did **Qwen CLI** follow:

  * API spec?
  * DB schema?
  * Auth rules?

### 3. Functional Validation

* All 5 features work:

  * Create task
  * View tasks
  * Update task
  * Delete task
  * Toggle completion

### 4. Security Validation

* Requests without JWT → 401
* User cannot access others’ tasks
* Token expiry enforced

---

## 8.2 Acceptance-Criteria-Based Checks

| Area    | Validation Check               |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Auth    | JWT required on every endpoint |
| Data    | User only sees own tasks       |
| API     | All REST endpoints functional  |
| UI      | Responsive on mobile + desktop |
| DB      | Data persists after restart    |
| Process | All code via Qwen CLI          |
| Audit   | All prompts logged             |

---

## 9. Quality Validation Framework

### Metrics

1. **Spec Quality**

   * Clarity
   * Completeness
2. **AI Compliance**

   * % of output matching spec
3. **Security Strength**

   * JWT enforcement
4. **Reproducibility**

   * Can project be rebuilt from specs only?
5. **Documentation**

   * APA style
   * Clear structure

---

## 10. Updated Tooling Map (Qwen CLI)


---

## 11. Example QWEN.md (Root)

```
# QWEN.md — Project Instructions

## Role of Qwen CLI
You are the sole implementation agent.
All changes must follow specs in /specs.

## Rules
- Do not invent features.
- Do not change architecture without spec update.
- Log every iteration in /docs/ai-log.md.

## Workflow
1. Read referenced spec.
2. Implement strictly.
3. If unclear, request clarification via spec notes.
```

---

## 12. Final Plan Summary

This /sp.plan ensures:

* ✅ Spec-first development
* ✅ AI-native execution with **Qwen CLI**
* ✅ Secure JWT-based multi-user system
* ✅ Research-concurrent methodology
* ✅ Clear validation and testing strategy
* ✅ Academic-ready documentation flow

---

## 13. Closing Statement

> This plan transforms the project from a simple app build into a **formal evaluation of AI-native, spec-driven software engineering**. Qwen CLI at every layer — planning, implementation, and validation — the system becomes reproducible, auditable, and suitable for both technical and academic assessment.
```

## Response

Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Console to Web Platform Transformation feature. The following artifacts were created:

1. **plan.md** - Implementation plan with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
2. **research.md** - Comprehensive research on technology decisions, architecture patterns, and security considerations
3. **data-model.md** - Detailed data model with entity definitions, database schema, and validation rules
4. **quickstart.md** - Quickstart guide with setup, configuration, and validation instructions
5. **contracts/task-api-contract.md** - API contract defining endpoints, request/response formats, and security considerations

The plan follows the AI-native, spec-driven development approach using Qwen CLI as the sole implementation agent. All constitutional requirements have been incorporated into the technical implementation, and the project is structured as a multi-user web application with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Outcome

The implementation plan is complete and all Phase 0 and Phase 1 deliverables have been created. The project is ready to move to Phase 2 where the implementation tasks will be defined using `/sp.tasks`. The architecture emphasizes security with JWT-based authentication and user data isolation, following the requirements specified in the original feature specification.
